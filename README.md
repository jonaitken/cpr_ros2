This is a ROS2 version of the Commonplace Robotics driver for the Mover6 robot. At present it only supports the Mover6 in ROS2 and is tested in Foxy (owing to our machine setup...). Usage instructions TBC, but in general it follows exactly the same principles as the ROS1 driver/interface.

NB: This has the joint direction for J1 corrected (difference in gear scale) so a positive rotation is positive about the frame.
